Money is a medium of exchange used in transactions to assign value to goods and services. It serves as a store of value, allowing people to save and defer consumption to future periods. Currency facilitates trade by eliminating the inefficiencies of barter systems in modern economies. Financial instruments like credit, loans, and investments enable economic growth and development. Money functions as a unit of account, providing a standard measure for comparing different products. Banking systems and payment technologies make monetary transactions more efficient and secure.
