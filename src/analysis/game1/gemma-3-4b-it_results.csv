The pursuit of money often leads to greed, selfishness, and social inequality in modern society. Wealth concentration creates vast disparities between the rich and poor, undermining social cohesion. Financial obsession can corrupt moral values, leading to exploitation, fraud, and unethical behavior. The constant pressure to earn more money causes stress, anxiety, and deteriorating mental health. Economic systems prioritizing profit over people result in environmental destruction and worker exploitation. Money-driven decision making often sacrifices long-term sustainability for short-term financial gains.
